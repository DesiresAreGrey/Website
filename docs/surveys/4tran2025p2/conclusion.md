### Rating

Glad to see that most people liked the survey :)

Reading through the survey comments, people also pretty positive about the survey and a lot of the stuff said was really touching. I also kept a
mental note of the suggestions people gave and I'll make sure to reread it all before making the next survey.

### Participation of the First Survey

Honestly very surprising to me, especially considering the first survey was only 2-3 months prior. I thought that there'd be more overlap with people
who took the first survey, but I guess the turnover rate for people in 4t4 is pretty high.

<div id="participant_of_first_survey-bar" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 300px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="participant_of_first_survey"
  data-title="First Survey Participation"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"]'

</div>

### Survey Length

People generally liked the survey length, but there were a few whought thought it was too short. Personally, I think it was way too long. It wasn't
long from a survey taking perspective but getting these results done took forever, and there are 12 whole pages of results which is a lot compared to
the 4 pages of the first survey.

<div id="survey-length-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="survey_length"
  data-title="Survey Length Rating"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"]'

## Conclusion

I'm glad the survey did well and that people liked it. I think next time my plan would be to do a survey across more of the trans community, rather
than just a 4tran survey. I have no idea how well that would go and if it would even be allowed, since for this survey I worked with 4tran's mods to
get my posts to stay up and get them pinned so that people would see them, and I have no idea if other more mainstream communities would be open to
that. <span style="font-size: 12px; color: #888">If you are a mod for one of those mainstream communities please reach out to me on Reddit if you're
interested.</span>

Feel free to check out the [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1qte7l0/the_extended_4tran_survey_20252_results/){ target="_blank" .reddit } 
and the [Tweet](https://x.com/DesiresAreGrey/status/2018102946144092559){ target="_blank" .twitter } about the survey results.

Again, disclaimer that I'm not a statistician or math person, so I can't really do any deeper sorta analysis of the data. There's also a lot of places
I could've gone deeper, like further breaking things down, but at the same time I already have 12 entire pages of results and I've spent so much time
working on this to the point I've been kinda neglecting myself so I could finish this asap. Its nice being on the end stretch now, writing out this
conclusion.

Hopefully everyone likes the results and no insane controversies come out of it or anything. Thanks to everyone who responded to the survey, and I was
really touched with some of the nice comments people left in the feedback section :)
