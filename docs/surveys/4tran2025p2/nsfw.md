### Natal PIV

Personally, I am very much not a fan of binary trans people using their natal genitalia for PIV. It's nice to see that the vast majority of binary
trans people feel the same. It makes sense that nonbinary people would be less against natal PIV, since their dysphoria varies a lot and is generally
less than binary trans people.

I would eventually like to do a general trans reddit survey to see how it compares, since the vibe of mainstream communities seems pretty different.

<div id="natal-piv-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_piv"
  data-title="Natal PIV"
  data-subtitle="Overall"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"]'
  >
</div>

Everyone talks about PIVP**ns, but they don't seem as common in 4tran circles compared to mainstream trans communities. As expected, gay men
would be the most likely to be into natal PIV, with straight men being the least likely (ignoring asexuals).

<div id="natal-piv-ftm-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_piv_ftm"
  data-title="Natal PIV"
  data-subtitle="FtM"
  data-colors='["#008FFB", "#15598c", "#1b3b4d"]'
  >
</div>

This seems pretty equal to the men, though bi women are slightly less into natal PIV than bi men.

<div id="natal-piv-mtf-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_piv_mtf"
  data-title="Natal PIV"
  data-subtitle="MtF"
  data-colors='["#FF4560", "#801927", "#4d1f2a"]'
  >
</div>

### Using Natal Genitalia

Generally this seems to be pretty similar to the natal PIV results, thought very slightly more people are open to using their natal genitalia in
general than for specifically PIV.


<div id="natal-using-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_using"
  data-title="Using Natal Genitalia"
  data-subtitle="Overall"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"]'
  >
</div>

#### FtM

Generally the same as PIV, though gay men are slightly more open to this compared to PIV.

<div id="natal-using-ftm-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_using_ftm"
  data-title="Using Natal Genitalia"
  data-subtitle="FtM"
  data-colors='["#008FFB", "#15598c", "#1b3b4d"]'
  >
</div>

Further breaking this up by most preferred gender, we can see how T4T vs T4C compare. 

Bi and gay trans men are equally positive towards using their natal genitalia for both cis and trans men, though there are more trans men neutral about it
with cis men than with trans men.

It is interesting how there is 1 straight trans man who would want to be penetrated by a trans woman.

#### MtF

The chart here is pretty similar to men.

<div id="natal-using-mtf-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_using_mtf"
  data-title="Using Natal Genitalia"
  data-subtitle="MtF"
  data-colors='["#FF4560", "#801927", "#4d1f2a"]'
  >
</div>

There are more bi trans women who want to use their natal genitalia with trans men than with cis men, which is unlike the vice versa for bi trans men.

Lesbian trans women are more open to using their natal genitalia with cis women than with trans women, which once again is unlike the vice versa for
gay trans men. Less lesbians are neutral about using their natal genitalia with cis women, meaning more lesbian trans women do not want to use their
natal genitalia with cis women compared to trans men wanting to use their natal genitalia with cis men.

It is interesting how there is 1 straight trans woman who would want to be penetrate a trans man, like how there way a straight trans man who would
want to be penetrated by a trans woman. Made for each other?

### Performing PIV

This question asked if people still performed PIV, regardless of how they felt on it (due to partner expectations/etc).

The numbers here are much higher than either Natal PIV or Using Natal Genitalia, showing that a good number of trans people perform PIV even if they
do not want to.

<div id="natal-does-piv-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_does_piv"
  data-title="Performing PIV"
  data-subtitle="Overall"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#2E294E"]'
  >
</div>

Gay and bisexual men are much more likely to perform PIV compared to straight men (though I'm not sure how straight trans men would be performing PIV except
with trans women). 

<div id="natal-does-piv-ftm-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_does_piv_ftm"
  data-title="Performing PIV"
  data-subtitle="FtM"
  data-colors='["#008FFB", "#183d52"]'
  >
</div>

Same story here, with bisexual women and lesbians being more likely to perform PIV than straight women. The amount of straight women performing PIV is
lower than the amount of straight men performing PIV, interestingly enough.

<div id="natal-does-piv-mtf-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="natal_does_piv_mtf"

  data-subtitle="MtF"
  data-colors='["#FF4560", "#521b28"]'

</div>

### Self Pleasure

Saying the actual word is too icky to me, so I just say self pleasure.

The disparity between men and women makes sense all things considered. However, what is interesting to me is that Q1 for women is zero, meaning that a
lot of women almost never self pleasure. The maximum for women is also lower than Q3 for men, so the gap is pretty large.

<div id="self-pleasure-boxplot" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 300px;"
  data-chart="boxplot"
  data-datakey="self_pleasure"
  data-title="Times Self Pleasuring Per Week"
  data-subtitle="Boxplot"

</div>

### Preferred Sexual Role

Unsurprisingly, men are dominant and women are submissive. However, many more women are submissive than men are dominant, though far more men are
switches than women.

<div id="sexual-role-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="sexual_role"
  data-title="Preferred Sexual Role"
  data-subtitle="Overall"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"]'
  >
</div>

Straight men being the most dominant is once again expected, and bi men are the most switchy. When compared to the [previous survey](/surveys/4tran2025/4/#nsfw){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }, 
there is a noticeable increase in the dominance of all men.

<div id="sexual-role-ftm-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="sexual_role_ftm"
  data-title="Preferred Sexual Role"
  data-subtitle="FtM"
  data-colors='["#008FFB", "#15598c", "#1b3b4d"]'
  >
</div>

Straight women are almost all submissives, with 95% being submissive and 5% being switches. Lesbians are the most dominant, though its only 8% who are.

<div id="sexual-role-mtf-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="sexual_role_mtf"
  data-title="Preferred Sexual Role"
  data-subtitle="MtF"
  data-colors='["#FF4560", "#801927", "#4d1f2a"]'
  >
</div>

### Preferred Sexual Position

More men are tops than women, which is once again unsurprising. The difference is much larger though, which does make sense especially since I'm
pretty sure this difference between the genders applies to cis people as well.

<div id="sexual-position-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="sexual_position"
  data-title="Preferred Sexual Position"
  data-subtitle="Overall"
  data-colors='["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"]'
  >
</div>

The vast majority of straight men are tops, and there are no bottom straight men. Not much else to say here as this is all pretty expected and
consistent with the previous survey. It would be interesting to see how this compares to mainstream trans communities though.

<div id="sexual-position-ftm-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="sexual_position_ftm"
  data-title="Preferred Sexual Position"
  data-subtitle="FtM"
  data-colors='["#008FFB", "#15598c", "#1b3b4d"]'
  >
</div>

Pretty expected and similar to position, except for lesbians who top more than they are submissive. 

<div id="sexual-position-mtf-ratio" 
  class="apexchart"
  style="height: 250px;"
  data-chart="ratio-bar"
  data-datakey="sexual_position_mtf"
