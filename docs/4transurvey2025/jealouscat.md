## Introduction

This analysis is an attempt to answer 3 important questions:

- Does starting age matter?
- How much does time on HRT matter?
- Does height matter?

### Filters

Except where otherwise stated, the following filters are used:

- Gender must be ‘Woman (MtF)’
- Surgeries must be ‘No’
- Age must be >= 16 and <=30
- Starting age must be >= 10
- Time on HRT must be >= 16
- Respondents who did not answer the passing question were excluded

### Passing Scale

The passing question was converted to a 4-point scale:

- Gigapassoid and passoid were set to equal 4
- Semipassoid was set to equal 3
- Nonpassoid was set to equal 2
- Gigahon was set to equal 1
