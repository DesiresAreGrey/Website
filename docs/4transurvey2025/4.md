## Miscellaneous

### AAP & AGP

I thought I'd add cis people back again for this. Being AAP as a man and AGP as a woman is trutrans imho.

I removed cis men and cis women from most of the other results since they were kinda useless. A lot of "cis men" were just trans women misgendering themselves, and a few "cis women" were just passoid/srs trans women; Its kinda hard to tell which cis men are actual cis men and which cis women are actual cis women so the results of these 2 groups were mostly unusable. I know there were a few cis women who were actual cis women but I couldn't go through the results one by one to verify the cisness of each person lol.

32% of men and 30% of women are AAP/AGP respectively. Nonbinary people are a mix of both but leaning more towards AGP. There are over twice as many AGP trans men than AAP trans women proportionally, which I thought was kinda funny.
