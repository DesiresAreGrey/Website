# The 2025 4tran Survey

## Miscellaneous

### AAP & AGP

I thought I'd add cis people back again for this. Being AAP as a man and AGP as a woman is trutrans imho.

I removed cis men and cis women from most of the other results since they were kinda useless. A lot of "cis men" were just trans women misgendering themselves, and a few "cis women" were just passoid/srs trans women; Its kinda hard to tell which cis men are actual cis men and which cis women are actual cis women so the results of these 2 groups were mostly unusable. I know there were a few cis women who were actual cis women but I couldn't go through the results one by one to verify the cisness of each person lol.

32% of men and 30% of women are AAP/AGP respectively. Nonbinary people are a mix of both but leaning more towards AGP. There are over twice as many AGP trans men than AAP trans women proportionally, which I thought was kinda funny.

<div id="axp-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("axp-chart", "aap_agp.json", "AAP & AGP", undefined, [], ['#4baefa', '#ff667d', '#2E294E']);
</script>

### Good Parent

Trans women really want to be mothers.

<div id="goodparent-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("goodparent-chart", "good_parent_nocis.json", "Good Parent", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>


### Mom w/ PCOS

I dont really remember why I added this question to the survey, I think someone asked me to. I'm not sure if theres anything statistically significant here except maybe the nonbinary people being noticbly lower than the binary trans people when it comes to mothers with PCOS. I hope whoever asked me to ask this question is satisfied with this answer lol.

<div id="mompcos-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("mompcos-chart", "mom_pcos_nocis.json", "Mom w/ PCOS", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

### Energy Drink Craving

This whole time I thought energy drinks was a trans woman thing, meanwhile trans women are the *least* likely to crave energy drinks with trans men being the most likely to crave them.

<div id="drink-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("drink-chart", "energy_drinks_nocis.json", "Energy Drink Craving", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

### Gaming

Honestly I expected a bit more of a difference here, I would've thought that trans women would game more often but maybe the stereotypes in my brain are kinda dumb.

<div id="gamingfreq-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("gamingfreq-chart", "gaming_frequency_nocis.json", "Gaming Frequency", undefined, [], ["#A300D6", "#8210e6", "#5653FE", "#2E294E", "#333f44"], 225);
</script>

This is also fairly even. I didn't really expect this either. The biggest differences I noticed is that trans men prefer puzzle games a bit more. Nonbinary people are not as much a fan of simulation games while they prefer sandbox games the most.

Honestly I expected gaming to be a lot more different between the genders...

<div id="gaming-genres-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("gaming-genres-chart", "gaming_genres_nocis.json", "Gaming Genres", undefined, [], ["#008FFB", "#00E396", "#FEB019", "#FF4560", "#775DD0", "#D7263D", "#1B998B", "#FEB019", "#F46036", "#2E294E"], 225);

<h3>Self Pleasuring Per Week</h3>

Men are the more horny (who woulda thought). I was actually getting a ton of people telling me how they couldn't believe I capped the max times per week at 25, I was actually getting pretty worried that the count for 25 was gonna be insanely high, screwing over the look of the graph, however that didn't seem to be the case...

<div class="chart-set">
  <input id="self-pleasure-a" class="vh" type="radio" name="self-pleasure">
  <input id="self-pleasure-b" class="vh" type="radio" name="self-pleasure" checked>
  
  <div class="chart-stack" style="min-height: 350px;">
    <div id="self-pleasure-column" class="chart-layer layer-a"></div>
    <div id="self-pleasure-box-plot" class="chart-layer layer-b"></div>
  </div>
  <script>
    createColumnChart("self-pleasure-column", "nsfw_self_pleasure.json", "Self Pleasuring Per Week", "Column", [3, 4], undefined, 350);
    createBoxPlot("self-pleasure-box-plot", "nsfw_self_pleasure_nocis_boxplot.json", "Self Pleasuring Per Week", "Box Plot", false, undefined, 350);
  </script>
  <div class="toggle">
    <label for="self-pleasure-a" class="noselect">Column</label>
    <label for="self-pleasure-b" class="noselect">Box Plot</label>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Preferred Role and Position</h3>

Men are the most dominant out of all the genders unsurprisingly, plus the majority of men are switches. Submissive women have the biggest ratio of anyone (68%). Nonbinary people are more of a mixed bag.

<div id="sexual-role-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("sexual-role-chart", "nsfw_sexual_role_nocis.json", "Preferred Role", "Overall", [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>

People's choice of position are actually a bit different from their role. Trans men are more likely to be tops compared to being a dom, nonbinary people also top more often than they are doms, and even trans women are slightly more likely to top than be a dom.

<div id="sexual-pos-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("sexual-pos-chart", "nsfw_sexual_position_nocis.json", "Preferred Position", "Overall", [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>

When breaking it up by sexuality it gets more interesting. Straight trans men are very dominant or a switch, with only 10% of them being submissive. Submissive bi trans men are also about 10%, but they are way more likely to be a switch than dominant. Gay trans men are the most submissive at 24% and are more likely to be submissive than dominant (18%).

<div id="sexual-role-ftm-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("sexual-role-ftm-chart", "nsfw_sexual_role_ftm.json", "Preferred Role", "FtM", [], ["#008FFB", "#15598c", "#1b3b4d"], 250);
</script>

Trans men are a *lot* more likely to be a top than a dom, tbh I thought the results would be almost the same when it came to comparing position and role but I guess I was wrong. Gay trans men, on the other hand, are more likely to bottom than they are to sub.

<div id="sexual-pos-ftm-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("sexual-pos-ftm-chart", "nsfw_sexual_position_ftm.json", "Preferred Position", "FtM", [], ["#008FFB", "#15598c", "#1b3b4d"], 250);
</script>

With trans women its a bit more straight forward, where most of them are submissive regardless of sexuality. Lesbians are the the most dominant but still remain under 10%. The rest is sorta self explanitory. 

Shout out to that one singular dominant straight trans woman.

<div id="sexual-role-mtf-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("sexual-role-mtf-chart", "nsfw_sexual_role_mtf.json", "Preferred Role", "MtF", [], ["#FF4560", "#801927", "#4d1f2a"], 250);
</script>

The percentage of trans women who are bottoms increases compared to submissives, however the number of tops went up to 3 compared to the 1 dom. Bi and lesbian women are also more likely to top than they are to be a dom. Vers's are generally the same as switches except for straight trans women who are less likely to be a switch

<div id="sexual-pos-mtf-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("sexual-pos-mtf-chart", "nsfw_sexual_position_mtf.json", "Preferred Position", "MtF", [], ["#FF4560", "#801927", "#4d1f2a"], 250);
