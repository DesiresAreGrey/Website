# The 2025 4tran Survey

## Miscellaneous

### AAP & AGP

I thought I'd add cis people back again for this. Being AAP as a man and AGP as a woman is trutrans imho.

I removed cis men and cis women from most of the other results since they were kinda useless. A lot of "cis men" were just trans women misgendering themselves, and a few "cis women" were just passoid/srs trans women; Its kinda hard to tell which cis men are actual cis men and which cis women are actual cis women so the results of these 2 groups were mostly unusable. I know there were a few cis women who were actual cis women but I couldn't go through the results one by one to verify the cisness of each person lol.

32% of men and 30% of women are AAP/AGP respectively. Nonbinary people are a mix of both but leaning more towards AGP. There are over twice as many AGP trans men than AAP trans women proportionally, which I thought was kinda funny.

<script>
    createRatioBarChart("axp-chart", "aap_agp.json", "AAP & AGP", undefined, [], ['#4baefa', '#ff667d', '#2E294E']);
</script>

### Good Parent

Trans women really want to be mothers.

<div id="goodparent-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("goodparent-chart", "good_parent_nocis.json", "Good Parent", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>


### Mom w/ PCOS

I dont really remember why I added this question to the survey, I think someone asked me to. I'm not sure if theres anything statistically significant here except maybe the nonbinary people being noticbly lower than the binary trans people when it comes to mothers with PCOS. I hope whoever asked me to ask this question is satisfied with this answer lol.

<div id="mompcos-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("mompcos-chart", "mom_pcos_nocis.json", "Mom w/ PCOS", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

### Energy Drink Craving

This whole time I thought energy drinks was a trans woman thing, meanwhile trans women are the *least* likely to crave energy drinks with trans men being the most likely to crave them.

<div id="drink-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("drink-chart", "energy_drinks_nocis.json", "Energy Drink Craving", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

### Gaming

Honestly I expected a bit more of a difference here, I would've thought that trans women would game more often but maybe the stereotypes in my brain are kinda dumb.

<div id="gamingfreq-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("gamingfreq-chart", "gaming_frequency_nocis.json", "Gaming Frequency", undefined, [], ["#A300D6", "#8210e6", "#5653FE", "#2E294E", "#333f44"], 225);
</script>

This is also fairly even. I didn't really expect this either. The biggest differences I noticed is that trans men prefer puzzle games a bit more. Nonbinary people are not as much a fan of simulation games while they prefer sandbox games the most.

Honestly I expected gaming to be a lot more different between the genders...

<div id="gaming-genres-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("gaming-genres-chart", "gaming_genres_nocis.json", "Gaming Genres", undefined, [], ["#008FFB", "#00E396", "#FEB019", "#FF4560", "#775DD0", "#D7263D", "#1B998B", "#FEB019", "#F46036", "#2E294E"], 225);
