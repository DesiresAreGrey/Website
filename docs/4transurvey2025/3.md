## Personality

### Incel/Femcel

This one surprised me. I knew that more men would be incels than women being femcels, but I didn't expect the difference to only be about 2 percent. What surprised me even more is that nonbinary incels would be the most common proportionally.

<div id="incel-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("incel-chart", "incel_femcel_nocis.json", "Incel/Femcel", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

### T4T or T4C

T4T rates seems pretty even between men and women, with men preferring T4T a bit more than women. If you enable the `No preference` option, you can see that most trans men have no preference and are fine with either T4T or T4C while women tend to be very slightly more picky (only a 2% difference).

<div id="t4t-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("t4t-chart", "t4t_nocis.json", "T4T or T4C", "Overall", [1], ["#7B61FF", "#3f51b5", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

Interestingly, T4C is the most popular among gay men (but still remains under 50%). T4T stays the most popular

<div id="t4t-ftm-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("t4t-ftm-chart", "t4t_ftm.json", "T4T or T4C", "FtM", [1], ["#008FFB", "#435259", "#1a4566"], 250);
</script>

The power of cis dick, 67% of straight women that have a preference prefer cis men.

</script>

<div id="t4t-mtf-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("t4t-mtf-chart", "t4t_mtf.json", "T4T or T4C", "MtF", [1], ["#FF4560", "#4d4144", "#661a24"], 250);
</script>

### Diagnoses

Trans men are the most likely to be officially diagnosed out of the genders, and trans men with autism are more likely to be officially diagnosed than self diagnosed. Trans women are generally more autistic than trans men, but are more often self diagnosed than officially diagnosed.

<div id="autism-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("autism-chart", "autism_flipped_nocis.json", "Autism", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>

As expected, women have bpd more often than men. Nonbinary people share almost the same percentages as women interestingly enough. If you compare between only officially diagnosed and self diagnosed, trans men with bpd are (again) around 2x more likely to be officially diagnosed than trans women.

<div id="bpd-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("bpd-chart", "bpd_flipped_nocis.json", "BPD", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>

Seems that women are more mentally ill than men once again...

<div id="bdd-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("bdd-chart", "bdd_flipped_nocis.json", "BDD", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"], 225);
</script>

Honestly, I expected there to be a bigger difference between the passoid levels having BDD and I expected it to go up with passing level, though that generally does seem to be true if you disable the self diagnosed. But it seems that for some reason passoids and gigahon/gigapoons are the least likely to admit to having BDD.

<div id="bdd-passing-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("bdd-passing-chart", "bdd_passing_nocis.json", "BDD", "Based on Passing Level", [], ["#7B61FF", "#5642bd", "#2E294E"]);
</script>

### Dating Height

Men are pretty much exactly 50:50 on whether they have a minimum preference or not, and if they do have a preference its very small. Women on the other hand generally have a preference and that preference seems to be around 5'5 to 5'6.

<div class="chart-set">
  <input id="dating-height-min-a" class="vh" type="radio" name="view-dating-height-min" checked>
  <input id="dating-height-min-b" class="vh" type="radio" name="view-dating-height-min">
  
  <div class="chart-stack" style="min-height: 400px;">
    <div id="dating-height-min-haspref" class="chart-layer layer-a"></div>
    <div id="dating-height-min-pop-pyramid" class="chart-layer layer-b"></div>
  </div>
  <script>
    createRatioBarChart("dating-height-min-haspref", "dating_height_min_haspref_nocis.json", "Minimum Dating Height", "Preference", [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 400);
    createPopPyramidChart("dating-height-min-pop-pyramid", "dating_height_min_pop_pyramid.json", "Minimum Dating Height", "Population Pyramid", 15, 400);
  </script>
  <div class="toggle">
    <label for="dating-height-min-a" class="noselect">Preference</label>
    <label for="dating-height-min-b" class="noselect">Population Pyramid</label>
  </div>
</div>

Looking at this, men are less picky compared to women for both the minimum and maximum dating heights. 41% (lol) of women have a maximum preference while 50% of men have a minimum preference. Men's preference seems to be around 5'11 which feels a lot more generous than women's preference for minimum height being 5'5.

<div class="chart-set">
  <input id="dating-height-max-a" class="vh" type="radio" name="view-dating-height-max" checked>
  <input id="dating-height-max-b" class="vh" type="radio" name="view-dating-height-max">
  
  <div class="chart-stack" style="min-height: 400px;">
    <div id="dating-height-max-haspref" class="chart-layer layer-a"></div>
    <div id="dating-height-max-pop-pyramid" class="chart-layer layer-b"></div>
  </div>
  <script>
    createRatioBarChart("dating-height-max-haspref", "dating_height_max_haspref_nocis.json", "Maximum Dating Height", "Preference", [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 400);
    createPopPyramidChart("dating-height-max-pop-pyramid", "dating_height_max_pop_pyramid.json", "Maximum Dating Height", "Population Pyramid", 15, 400);
  </script>
  <div class="toggle">
    <label for="dating-height-max-a" class="noselect">Preference</label>
    <label for="dating-height-max-b" class="noselect">Population Pyramid</label>
  </div>
</div>

### Politics

No surprise that trans people lean heavily left. Men are very slightly less left leaning but nothing really interesting other than that. I wish I did this similar to the parental acceptance so I could compare political leaning pretransition vs now but oh well.

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #888; margin-top: -0.25rem;">0 being left wing and 10 being right wing</p>

<div class="chart-set">
  <input id="leaning-a" class="vh" type="radio" name="leaning">
  <input id="leaning-b" class="vh" type="radio" name="leaning" checked>
  
  <div class="chart-stack" style="min-height: 350px;">
    <div id="leaning-column" class="chart-layer layer-a"></div>
    <div id="leaning-box-plot" class="chart-layer layer-b"></div>
  </div>
  <script>
    createColumnChart("leaning-column", "political_leaning_nocis.json", "Political Leaning", "Now", [], undefined, 350);
    createBoxPlot("leaning-box-plot", "political_leaning_nocis_boxplot.json", "Political Leaning", "Now", false, 350);
  </script>
  <div class="toggle">
    <label for="leaning-a" class="noselect">Column</label>
    <label for="leaning-b" class="noselect">Box Plot</label>
  </div>
</div>

Funnily enough, nonbinary people were the most MAGA pretransition and (if you enable the `None of these` option) were the most likely to have been part of an alt right or anti trans movement. 30% of trans men who were part of these movements were terfs, which seems like a good chunk. Almost 50% of trans women who were part of these movements was part of the manosphere (tbh I don't know much about the manosphere so idk what that means).

The good news is that about 80% of trans people were part of no such movement :)

<div id="movements-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("movements-chart", "pretrans_movements_nocis.json", "Pretransition Movements", undefined, [4], ["#4caf50", "#3f51b5", "#F46036", "#D7263D", "#2E294E"], 225);
