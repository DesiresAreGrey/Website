## Personality

### Incel/Femcel

This one surprised me. I knew that more men would be incels than women being femcels, but I didn't expect the difference to only be about 2 percent. What surprised me even more is that nonbinary incels would be the most common proportionally.

<script>
    createRatioBarChart("incel-chart", "incel_femcel_nocis.json", "Incel/Femcel", undefined, [], ["#7B61FF", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

### T4T or T4C

T4T rates seems pretty even between men and women, with men preferring T4T a bit more than women. If you enable the `No preference` option, you can see that most trans men have no preference and are fine with either T4T or T4C while women tend to be very slightly more picky (only a 4% difference).

Last year, 75% of trans men prefered st4t over st4c while for trans women it was only 50%. I guess things have changed since then.

<div id="t4t-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("t4t-chart", "t4t_nocis.json", "T4T or T4C", "Overall", [1], ["#7B61FF", "#3f51b5", "#00E0B8"], 225);
</script>

Interestingly, T4C is the most popular among gay men (but still remains under 50%).

<div id="t4t-ftm-chart"></div>
<script>
    createRatioBarChart("t4t-ftm-chart", "t4t_ftm.json", "T4T or T4C", "FtM", [1], ["#008FFB", "#546E7A", "#1a4566"], 250);
</script>

The power of cis dick, 67% of straight trans women that have a preference prefer cis men.

### Diagnoses
